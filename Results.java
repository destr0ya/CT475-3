//EM
//I created this class in order to find a clean and effective way to accumulate the results
//generated by LogisticRegression.test(). This means that we can store the predicted/actual
//values as strings, yet still save a double for the accuracy of the test. By using this
//method, we are able to get the overall accuracy of a number of tests.

public class Results {

    String values;
    double accuracy;

    public Results(String val, double acc) {
        this.values = val;
        this.accuracy = acc;
    }

    public double getAccuracy() {
        return accuracy;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return values;
